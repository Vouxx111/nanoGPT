Tell me about the Tower of Babel.
What would you like to know?

Just give me a overview.
During the time of the Tower of Babel there was only one language. Those who lived in the plain of Shinar planned to build a extremely large tower. God seeing this made many languages to confuse the people to foil there plan. His intention was to limit the power of man by making communication difficult or impossible.

Where can I read about this?
(Genesis 11:1-9)

What were the effects of this?
God scrabbling language caused people to spread out across the globe.



What is the Lords Prayer?
The Lords Prayer is a example and template Jesus gave us on how to pray (Matthew 6:9-13)

Is this the only prayer I should pray?
No, the Lords Prayer while being a great prayer you don't have to exclusively pray it, the Lords Prayer is also a great template for you to use in your own personal prayer.

You said it's a template, what do you mean by that?
The Lords Prayer is a template for what he should include in our prayers. A way to think of this is using the PRAY acronym, the P stands for: praise, the R stands for: repent, the A stands for: ask, and the Y stands for yield.

Explain the template a little more.
When praying the Lords Prayer teaches us to, 1: praise God for all he's done and his greatness, 2: repent for your sins and ask for forgiveness for breaking the Lords laws, 3: ask for what you need, 4: yield your requests to Gods plan, and surrender yourself to Gods will.
